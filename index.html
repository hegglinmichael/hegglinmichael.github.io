      <h3>Machine Learning & Signal Processing - MBARI Joint Project</h3>
      <p>
        Worked with MBARI(Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute) to identify sperm whale 
        clicks.  The team used unsupervised clustering models to sift through teribytes of data.
        The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can detect or classify sperm whale clicks among many sounds recorded by the MARS hydrophone off the coast of MBARI.
        The primary issue faced with that approach is the scarcity of labeled data â€” there are upwards of 250 gigabytes of data spanning multiple years, among which sperm whale clicks are not very frequent and require much time and biological expertise to identify, making it very difficult to gather a sizable and usable labeled data sets.
      </p>

      <h3>Tractor Hacking - iFixit Joint Project</h3>
      <p>
        Worked with iFixit to uncover John Deer tractor codes.  John Deere uses "security through obscurity" to process sensor signals within the tractor.  Due to this obscurity, farmers don't have the abilities to fix their own tractors.  The goal was to uncover the meaning of the codes, and create an OBDII like connector for tractors.
      </p>

      <h3>Image Detection Butter Robot - Senior Project</h3>
      <p>
        Built a robot that identifies and butter bread using machine learning.  The machine learning model is run on a raspberry pi, which is also connected to motors and servos.  The model was trained used supervised techniques, and optimized to run on a raspberry pi.

      <h3>Thrones - Android Application</h3>
      <p>
        This android application was an idea born from a group of cross-country runners.  The idea was to have an application that could find the user the nearest bathroom.  This was one of the first android applications I built!
      </p>

      <h3>Guitar Tuner - Android Application</h3>
      <p>
        This application was a project I made in conjunction with another project.  I was making a wooden electric guitar in the shop, and decided it would be cool to make an application that could tune the guitar I built.  I built the application using lots of audio libraries, and in the end it was a success!

      <h3>The Circle Game Above!</h3>
      <p>
        This game was made just for the website!  I remember playing it in highschool to kill time during class, and I wanted to remake the game in my own JavaScript.
